        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <em>Beyti</em> is a newly invented Turkish kebab that consists of ground beef or lamb, skewered and grilled. It’s then wrapped in lavash and served topped with tomato sauce and yogurt- all the while remaining juicy on both ends.  
          The dish is named after its creator Beyti Güler, the owner of the famous restaurant “Beyti” in Istanbul.</p>
